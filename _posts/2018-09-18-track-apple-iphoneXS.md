I have not written anything in awhile and I basically suck at writing so here goes :)


Step 1 (AFAIK this only works for orders through Apple.com - If i am wrong please let me know) - Getting the tracking details
------------------AS

Some of these steps have been taken from various other arcitcles over the years and I am not going to source them all because I am lazy

### Track By Refference Number (Which is your phone number)

```c

	Step 1: Visit UPS.com and click on the green tracking arrow.
	Step 2: Click on ‘Track by Reference’:
	Step 3: Under ‘Shipment Reference’, enter in your 10-digit phone number associated with your Apple pre-order (NO DASHES) and then click ‘Track’ at the bottom
	Step 4: Profit! - After that, you should see more details regarding your delivery (or deliveries). Our iPhone XS Max is showing its last location as ZhengZhou, China, as of today.
```
